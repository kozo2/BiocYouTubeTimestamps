# BiocYouTubeTimestamps
Adding timestamps to Bioconductor YouTube videos!
Sometimes, it may take a few weeks or months for timestamps to be added, but fear not, they will all be added!
Your helpful contribution will not be in vain.

## Get Involved
If you want to help add timestamps to the YouTube videos found here: https://www.youtube.com/@bioconductor, please follow the below steps:

- See https://github.com/kozo2/BiocYouTubeTimestamps/blob/main/BioC2023/izQDkv-lZkE.md for an example of what you should do.
- Find a video without time stamps that interests you on the Bioconductor YouTube channel
- Watch the video, and create 'YouTube Video ID.md' with descriptive timestamps.
- Send a pull request for 'YouTube Video ID.md' that includes a timestamp.
- Once the time stamps are accepted we will add a S/o to you in the video description as a thank you for your help!

Thank you!
